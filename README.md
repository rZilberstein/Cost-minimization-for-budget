Cost minimization department budget
# Book Demand Predictor

A Python project that predicts the number of basic and advanced books needed for a mathematics department and minimizes total book expenditure.

## Key Features

- Simulates historical demand for basic and advanced books over multiple years.
- Applies a reusability rate to simulate book sharing among students.
- Uses a linear regression model to predict next year's demand based on historical trends.
- Calculates and minimizes book costs by applying bulk discounts.

## Project Structure

- `book_demand_predictor/` - Contains the main prediction and cost-optimization functionality.
- `example_usage.py` - Shows how to use the predictor.
- `README.md` - Documentation for the project.

## Installation

Ensure you have `numpy` and `scikit-learn` installed:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
